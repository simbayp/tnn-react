      "title": "Differences Between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2",
      "body": "The internet has come a long way since its inception, and one of the fundamental technologies that powers the web is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, commonly known as HTTP. Over the years, HTTP has seen several versions, each designed to enhance the performance and capabilities of web communication. Two significant versions of HTTP are HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2. In this blog, we'll delve into the key differences between these two protocols.\nThe Need for HTTP/2\nHTTP/1.1 served the internet for over a decade and proved to be a robust and effective protocol. However, with the rapid evolution of web applications and the growing need for faster, more efficient communication, it became clear that HTTP/1.1 had some limitations. Some of the key issues with HTTP/1.1 included:\nHead-of-Line Blocking: In HTTP/1.1, all requests and responses were sent sequentially. If a large resource (like an image or a script) blocked the connection, other requests had to wait in line, leading to slower page loading times.\nHigh Latency: Multiple round trips were required to establish and close a connection for each resource, causing increased latency.\nRedundant Headers: HTTP/1.1 required each resource to have its own set of headers, which resulted in duplicated data and larger payloads.\nNo Support for Server Push: HTTP/1.1 lacked native support for the server to push resources to the client, meaning the browser had to request each resource individually.\nHTTP/2 was developed to address these issues and improve the overall web performance. It was standardized in 2015 and has gained widespread adoption since then.\nKey Differences between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2\nMultiplexing: One of the most significant differences is how data is transmitted. In HTTP/1.1, resources were fetched sequentially, leading to head-of-line blocking. In contrast, HTTP/2 allows multiple resources to be sent in parallel over a single connection. This multiplexing significantly reduces page load times, as all resources can be fetched simultaneously.\nHeader Compression: HTTP/1.1 sent headers in plain text, which added unnecessary overhead. HTTP/2 uses a more efficient header compression algorithm, called HPACK, which reduces the size of headers and minimizes redundant data.\nBinary Protocol: HTTP/1.1 used a text-based protocol, which required parsing. HTTP/2 employs a binary protocol, which is more efficient for both clients and servers to process.\nServer Push: One of the most innovative features of HTTP/2 is server push. With server push, the server can proactively send resources to the client before they are requested. This can reduce latency and further speed up page loading times.\nPrioritization: HTTP/2 allows clients to assign priorities to different resources, ensuring that more critical resources are loaded first. This feature helps improve the overall user experience.\nConnection Handling: In HTTP/1.1, multiple connections were often needed to load all the resources on a page. HTTP/2, on the other hand, uses a single connection, reducing latency and resource overhead.\nBackward Compatibility: HTTP/2 is designed to be fully backward compatible with HTTP/1.1. This means that older clients and servers can still communicate using the older protocol if necessary.\nShould You Upgrade to HTTP/2?\nIf you're a website owner or developer, migrating to HTTP/2 is generally a good idea. The performance improvements, especially in terms of page load times and user experience, are substantial. Most modern web servers and browsers support HTTP/2, so compatibility is rarely an issue.\nThat said, the upgrade process may require some configuration changes, so make sure to consult with your hosting provider or server administrator. Additionally, while HTTP/2 is widely supported, some older devices or browsers may not benefit from it, so maintaining some level of HTTP/1.1 support may still be necessary.\nIn conclusion, HTTP/2 is a significant improvement over HTTP/1.1, addressing many of its limitations and providing a more efficient and faster web experience. As the web continues to evolve, it's essential to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies to ensure your web applications perform optimally and deliver a seamless user experience.",

      "title": "Understanding Objects and Their Internal Representation in JavaScript",
      "body": "JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used programming language that allows developers to create dynamic and interactive web applications. At the heart of JavaScript lies the concept of objects, which are fundamental to the language's structure. In this blog, we'll explore what objects are in JavaScript and how they are internally represented.\nWhat Are Objects in JavaScript?\nIn JavaScript, an object is a complex data type that can store and organize multiple values and functions. Objects are collections of key-value pairs, where each key (also known as a property) is associated with a value (either a data value or a function), creating a structure that allows for organizing, storing, and manipulating data efficiently.\nObjects are incredibly versatile and can represent a wide range of real-world entities. For example, you can use objects to model a person with properties like name, age, and gender, or you can create an object to represent a product with properties like name, price, and description.\nInternal Representation of Objects\nTo understand how objects are internally represented in JavaScript, it's essential to know that objects are not limited to one specific structure. The language itself provides flexibility, allowing you to create objects in different ways. The internal representation may vary, but we'll discuss the general principles here.",

      "title": "JavaScript Window and Document Object",
      "body": "First Things First: The DOM\nThe document is an object model of any HTML web page that is run in a browser application. Individual elements of an HTML page can be accessed through the document object model. Document objects are used to add dynamic content to a web page.\nMany times we must have thought that what exactly is the difference between Document and Window object in JavaScript. In this blog I will try to explain the difference between them from the perspective of a newbie developer. Let's see the window object first.\nWindow Object:\nThe window object is the global object of any document object model. It is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser. This window object has many properties like length, name, innerWidth, innerHeight, outerWidth, outerHeight, console etc. The window object is initialized as soon as that window appears on the viewport of a device. All children of window object can be accessed by using window.childName or just by childName since window is the global object of browsers.\nDocument Object:\nThe document object is a child of the window object. It can be accessed with window.document or just by document. The document object serves as an entry point into any web page's content. Document object also has many properties like activeElement, cookie, doctype, body, head etc. The DOM is contained inside the document object. This document object is initialized when the HTML file is parsed by the browser.",

      "title": "What is Git?",
      "body": "Most developers or beginners might have heard the term Git or GitHub in their learning phase. The git website itself mentions that it is 'a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency'.\nLet's understand what the term 'version control system' means. In the lifecycle of software development, many people contribute to its codebase or sometimes the same person can contribute many times. So a natural question arises, how does everyone know who contributed which part in the code or what new changes have been made recently? This is called versioning of source code. So now the phrase 'version control system' starts to make sense.",
